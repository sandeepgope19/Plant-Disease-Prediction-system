# 🌿 Plant Disease Prediction using CNN

This project is a deep learning-based image classification system for predicting plant diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). It aims to help farmers and agronomists detect crop diseases early using leaf images, leading to better yield and management practices.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Plant diseases cause significant losses in agricultural productivity. By leveraging computer vision and CNN models, we can automatically detect diseases from plant leaf images and identify their category.

This project:
- Uses a pre-labeled dataset of plant leaf images (such as the PlantVillage dataset).
- Trains a Convolutional Neural Network model to classify leaf images into healthy or diseased classes.
- Evaluates the model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and loss curves.

---

## 🧠 Key Features

- 🖼️ Image classification using CNN architecture
- 🔁 Data augmentation to improve generalization
- 📊 Visualization of training/validation loss and accuracy
- 🌱 Supports multiple plant types and diseases
- 🧪 High accuracy on unseen test data

---

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source**: [PlantVillage Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease)
- Contains images of healthy and diseased plant leaves.
- Multiple classes, including:
  - Tomato - Early blight, Late blight, Healthy
  - Potato - Late blight, Healthy
  - Corn - Leaf blight, Rust, Healthy

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib
- **IDE**: Jupyter Notebook
