# Plant-Disease-Prediction-system
This project involves building a deep learning-based system to automatically identify and classify plant diseases from leaf images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It aims to support farmers and agronomists in early detection and management of crop diseases, thereby improving agricultural productivity and sustainability.
